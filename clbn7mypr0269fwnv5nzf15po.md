# Dopamine Nation

Top 10 Lessons  learned from the book Dopamine Nation.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The world has been transformed from a place of scarcity to a place of abundance.
We live in unprecedented times with easy access to high dopamine stimuli: food, drugs, porn, social media, etc. All at the touch of a button.
"The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle"

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pain & pleasure are processed in the same place in the brain and they exist on a balance.
Push down on pleasure and the brain will push back on pain to bring it into equilibrium.
The brain's re-leveling toward pain is longer lasting and tends to get us stuck in pain.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Despite working to avoid pain, the pain is getting worse.
Globally, rates of happiness are declining, while rates of anxiety and depression are increasing.
Our avoidance of pain is making us miserable.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ The pain often comes in the form of craving:
  1 more episode
  1 more bite
  1 more hit

The problem is neuroadaptation. The pleasure stimulus weakens.
Our tolerance goes up.
That's why we seek every increasing amounts of pleasure.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£Eventually the scale rests on the side of pain.
We are in a dopamine deficit state.
It becomes harder and harder to feel pleasure, but easier to feel pain.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ If we can wait, the brain balances itself out.
For most, a month of abstinence resets the brain to normal dopamine activity.
For others, it can take longer and can reveal underlying psychiatric disorders.
For serious drugs, medical supervision is needed.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Pain is a pain-reliever.
Engaging in painful activities such as ice baths and running leads to more pleasure.
The brain levels itself out towards the side of pleasure. This is longer-lasting than a quick dopamine hit provided by a drug or a like on social media.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Being honest sets us free.
Addiction is often shrouded in lies. We don't consider the consequences.
Telling the truth makes us aware of our actions, keeps us accountable, and promotes close relationships.
Being vulnerable by telling the truth is powerful.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Prosocial shame humbles us.
This isn't destructive shame (slut shaming, body shaming, etc). Those should be condemned.
Prosocial shame in which one speaks honestly in a supportive environment leads to redemption.
Nobody is perfect. We are all worthy of forgiveness.

### üîü Finally, consider the use of a drug or destructive behavior over your lifetime.
We get consumed by the day, telling ourselves we'll do better tomorrow.
But do you want to be doing this a year from now? 5 years from now?
Embrace life and strive for balance.
That's a wrap!
