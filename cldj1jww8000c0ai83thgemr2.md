# Duplicate line in VS Code || Copy line down action || Copy and Paste shortcut | VS Code Shortcuts

Most of us are very familiar with the popular IDE known as VS Code. It is very useful to every programmer, coder as well as developer.

There are various kinds of shortcuts in vs code that enhances the coding speed and capabilities of developers. One of my favorite and most useful shortcuts is the copy-line-down action.

Go to the **Setting&gt;keyboard shortcut&gt;** the search Copy line down action.

Click on the pencil(edit) and press the desired key combination for that action and press ENTER.
