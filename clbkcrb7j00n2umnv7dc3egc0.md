# Rework

Top 12 lessons learned from book -Rework 

### 1.Mistakes and Learning
📝 Learning  from your success will always tell you what to do next, therefore it is important to understand that failure is not a prerequisite to success.
👉🏻 When you learn from your mistakes, you learn what NOT to do.

### 2.Don’t let the past drive the future
❌ You have to learn to go in new directions, because that is what suitable today.
✅ If you break your tasks into smaller tasks, you are much more likely to be accurate, compared to estimate something big.

### 3.Premature Growth means death
🌐 See what feels right, small companies wish they were big, and big companies wish they were more agile.
❗ Premature growth is a death point, don’t grow for the sake of growing.

### 4. Don’t be a Workaholic
🗝️Workaholics create more problems than they solve. If you always work hard you don’t know what are considered to be real problems.
❌  Work hard when required, not all the time — you will burn out.

### 5. Let your customers miss you
🔎 You want your customers to feel that if you stop doing what you do, then they will feel something is missing.
⚙️ Build stuff you want to use, when you solve your own problem, you know how to solve it.

### 6.Don’t be a hypocrite and stay in control!
🎭 Don’t be a hypocrite like these companies who say they are sorry to keep you waiting, but still put you on hold for hours!
⛔ that think a robot is showing “genuine affection” is silly.

### 7. Worry about the necessities.
🔔 Whatever you decide to do, ask yourself if it's adding value. Value is about balance, will your “change” actually do anything?
⚠️ Don’t add unless it has a real impact on your product, and avoid throwing good time at bad work!
### 8. Work smart, and avoid interruptions!
👉🏻 Some people work hours through the night when there is little or no interruption.
❗ You need to focus and for long periods of time.

### 9.Meetings, the right way…
✍🏻 Meetings generally are so vague they never have a goal.
🟠 Create a “JUDO” approach, this is when you find a simple solution to a complex problem, even if its not perfect.

### 10.Small victories
💪🏻 Accomplish small victories along the way. When  you start small, get feedback instantly, and keep this process up until you go big.
🎯 You can manage small victories by prioritizing.

### 11.Creativity
🌀 Be creative, and make the product  you.
❌ Do not copy anyone, focus on injecting what is unique about you into your product.

### 12.Take responsibility
✋🏼 There are always people who will call you out on your flaws, hold your hands up straight away.
✔️ The highest person ranked should take responsibility and should address the issue promptly.
You can't improve if you don't know what you're doing wrong.
