# Dear First Love,

Dear first love,

Do you think of me like I think of you sometimes? You know I miss our times.   
Sometimes when I remember how happy you used to make me. I don't know what happened to us but believe me I didn't leave you for another girl. I didn't leave you just to take revenge. I fell out of love. 

I cried so much after I left you. I cried when I saw your picture with your new boyfriend which you set as your display picture just to hurt me. I cried on Valentine's day because once I waited 2 hours for you on that day which caused a lot of trouble. I cried when I remembered you were not mine anymore. I cried when I heard you said bad stuff about me. I cried so many times because I miss you but even for a second I don't regret leaving you. 

I still think I owe you an apology. I am sorry that I left you out of the blue but trust me I did not leave you for another person. I did not leave you just to take revenge. I was immature, I didn't know how to handle a relation. They way I behaved I was an immarure, spoilt boy. I am sorry. I am sorry but I fell out of love. We fell out of love. And please don't deny it that you were also hoping for a break up.  

 When I was drifting away you didn't stop that and you were more mature than me. You didn't do anything wrong in case you treated me like a real king and I thought anybody would treat me better than that lol. I was wrong. I am sorry. Please don't have any hurt feelings. Try to understand me. It's been 1.5 years since our break up and I am sorry. I am really sorry for leaving you.

You know sometimes I think about those times when I was mad about you. How happy I was when you came back to me. That feeling I can never find anywhere. I miss that feeling. I don't miss us. I miss our time, period. I was a completely different person when I was with you. Sometimes I listen to the songs you used to love.   

Sometimes I go through our old chats just to hear your voice in voice messages that you used to send me. I do all these just to go back to the to time when I was carefree, happy and laughed wholed heartedly. The way you made me happy like nobody else did and nobody else will. The way you handled my tanturms, they way you pampered me, the way you cared for me (well you cared too much, sometimes I got annoyed) those were marvellous. 

But I did the right thing leaving you. I heard that you broke up with that boy. I hope you are doing fine.

I don't miss you, I don't miss us. I just miss that time. I don't love you anymore. Maybe I just miss that specific feeling. Just like people say first will always have a place in our heart and you are that to me. I am sorry again for leaving you abruptly. I am really sorry. But I dont regret leaving you. I hope you would forgive me.

**But at the end, do you think of me?**

Sincerely,
