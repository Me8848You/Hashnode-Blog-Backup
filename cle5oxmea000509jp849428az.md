# How we gave our Business Pitch Of The HULT Prize 2023 OnCampus Final Event

As the deadline approaches the End, I wasn't ready to register our team(Unknown) because there is no valid idea in my mind regarding the topic "**Redesigning Fashion**". But later on, Gaurab suggested filling out the form without any idea just to make sure that we were not ready to miss this opportunity right there, So I filled up the form.

This year's Hult Prize 2023 topic was "**Redesigning Fashion**\-To make it sustainable" looks quite difficult for us because non of us are familiar with the fashion industry. But there are no excuses for us, We did research and found a very suitable idea regarding this topic and are ready for the **final pitch** :)

# 2\. PROBLEM

Main Problem with Fashion Industry in today's world:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676460003463/1c1a9c4c-36ac-47ae-8ab0-deab237390a3.png align="center")

1. **Non-Disposal & Non-Sustainable:**
    
    Today the fashion industry produces clothes that do not decompose & affect the environment. Cotton clothes take a very long time to decompose in the environment completely. Due to fast fashion, these products are also not sustainable.
    
2. **250 Trillions Litres of Water Consumption:**
    
    The production of cotton needs more than 250 Trillion liters of water. Which is a very large amount. But the use of Bamboo consumes much less water than cotton.
    
3. **Use of Pesticides**:
    
    For the production of cotton, we need to use pesticides. In the big industry, the amount of pesticide use is increasing day by day which directly affects our environment. In our case, for the production of bamboo, we don't need to use any kind of pesticide that directly and indirectly affect our environment.
    
4. **Non-recyclable Packaging**:
    
    In today's world, we live in a plastic world. Turn around and look everywhere you will definitely see plastic products here and there. We use very large amounts of plastic products which directly or indirectly harm the environment. But with the use of Bambshion products, this problem is completely solved. In our case, we provide a Bag which is made from bamboo with our products (Clothes). This bag is Sustainable, Biodegradable & Multipurpose. With the use of this bag, the use of plastic bags will reduce even if on a small scale.
    

# 3\. SOLUTION

The solution to all the problems with today's fashion industry is **Fabric Made**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676459923237/dd683239-d256-4d2f-9b7d-d9313e337315.png align="center")

**Bamboo & WHY this?\***

1. **Sustainable:**
    
    **Bamboo fabric is an eco-friendly fabric that has a low environmental effect**. Furthermore, it preserves the biodegradability of natural components. The textile industry is seeing an increase in demand for this fabric due to its numerous functional qualities.
    
2. **UV Protection**:
    
    UV Protection: **Bamboo fabric offers UV protection and can cut out up to 97% of harmful UV rays**. For this reason, it has become increasingly popular in warmer climates such as Australia, where skin cancer is prevalent.
    
3. **Odour Resistant**:
    
    ***Bamboo's*** fiber composition has a natural bio-agent called ***bamboo*** kun that makes it naturally anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and ***odor-resistant***.
    
4. **Soft Fabric**:
    
    ***Bamboo*** rayon and similar semi-synthetic ***fabrics*** are not as ***soft*** or tensile as the real thing, and they certainly have negligible antibacterial benefits.
    

# 4\. SOURCING

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676298627639/b74a287a-0fe8-4494-bc49-137f5b151dab.png align="center")

The sourcing of bamboo is very easy in comparison to cotton and other fiber-producing materials. The following reasons make it easy sourcing as:

1. Regenerative: **Bamboo Has Regeneration Superpowers**
    
    Well, rather than directing energy towards regaining its lost height, a cut bamboo stalk will simply unfurl new leaves.
    
2. No-pesticide: Unlike trees and other plants that need to be treated with harmful pesticides and toxic chemicals, **bamboo plants are grown organically without the need of any chemical treatments**.
    
3. Need less water: The shallow rhizomes and roots don't need very deep watering, but they should be watered often, **at least once a week**. Young bamboo and fresh transplants will need more water, and in the heat of summer, you may need to water them two or three times a week.
    
4. Production of O2: Bamboo is a crucial element in the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. **A grove of bamboo release 35% more oxygen than an equivalent stand of trees**. Because of this, planting bamboo is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint and help fight global warming.
    

# 5\. MANUFACTURING

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676298790137/cea5f607-4fe7-446e-90eb-f9cb5db443fd.png align="center")

* <mark>Bamboo Fiber Processing:</mark>  
    The general process for chemically manufacturing bamboo fiber using hydrolysis alkalization with multi-phase [**bleaching technology**](https://textilelearner.net/bleaching-process-in-textile-its-purposes-and-chemical-requirements/) – which is the dominant technology for producing regenerated bamboo fiber – goes like this:
    
* Bamboo leaves and the soft, inner pith from the hard bamboo trunk are extracted and crushed. The crushed bamboo cellulose is soaked in a solution of 15% to 20% sodium hydroxide at a temperature between 20<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C for one to three hours to form alkali cellulose. The bamboo alkali cellulose is then pressed to remove any excess sodium hydroxide solution. The alkali cellulose is crashed by a grinder and left to dry for 24 hours. Roughly a third as much carbon disulfide is added to the bamboo alkali cellulose to sulfurize the compound causing it to jell. Any remaining carbon disulfide is removed by evaporation due to decompression and cellulose sodium xanthogenate is the result. A diluted solution of sodium hydroxide is added to the cellulose sodium xanthogenate dissolving it to create a viscose solution consisting of about 5% sodium hydroxide and 7% to 15% bamboo fiber cellulose.
    
* The viscose bamboo cellulose is forced through spinneret nozzles into a large container of a diluted sulfuric acid solution which hardens the viscose bamboo cellulose sodium xanthogenate and reconverts it to cellulose bamboo fiber threads which are spun into bamboo fiber yarns to be woven into reconstructed and regenerated [**bamboo fabric**](https://textilelearner.net/application-and-uses-of-bamboo-fabric/). Newer manufacturing facilities have begun using other technologies to chemically manufacture bamboo fiber that is more benign and eco-friendlier. The chemical manufacturing process used to produce lyocell from wood cellulose can be modified to use bamboo cellulose. The [**lyocell process**](https://textilelearner.net/processing-and-application-of-lyocell/), also used to manufacture TENCEL®, uses N-methyl morpholine-N-oxide which is non-toxic to humans and the chemical manufacturing processes are closed-loop so 99.5% of the chemicals used during the processing are captured and recycled to be used again. [**Nanotechnology**](https://textilelearner.net/nanotechnology-in-textiles-for-research-development/) is being also used for bamboo fibers.
    

**<mark>Manufacturing Process of Bamboo Fiber:</mark>**

* The weaving of bamboo fabric:  
    The [**tensile strength**](https://textilelearner.net/tensile-strength-of-fabric/) of the bamboo fiber is very low as it is recommended to give 350-410 twists per meter. Weaving should be carried out in low moisture regain and low tension as bamboo fiber has a lower tensile strength at low moisture regain rate. It is better to choose denatured starch as the main component of the sizing agent for providing strength.
    
* Pretreatment:  
    Light sizing can be carried out and the desiring rate can be around 80%. Bamboo fabrics do not usually require scouring, or [**mercerizing**](https://textilelearner.net/cellulose-fibers-due-to-mercerization/) but to improve fabric quality these can be carried out.
    
* Dyeing:  
    Bamboo fiber is sensitive to acid or alkali so the volume should be maintained carefully. [**Reactive dyestuff**](https://textilelearner.net/reactive-dyes-classification-dyeing-mechanism/) is suitable as it reacts with bamboo fiber in a mild alkaline medium. Bamboo textiles are suitable to be dyed on a jigger or winch loose rope dyeing machine. In dyeing, the volume of calcined soda cannot exceed 25g/L. The temperature cannot exceed 100<sup>o</sup>C.
    

# 6\. DISTRIBUTION

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676298821050/cc1375da-eef5-4031-a6e5-b5c26c72bd0d.png align="center")

Now products are ready for distribution. How we are going to distribute our product then?

Well, there are various methods of distributing products but according to our resources and budget Intensive distribution is suitable for us. Also, we are a growing start-up that's why it become more beneficial to us.

Then What is intensive Distribution ...?\*

**a method of marketing where a company sells a product in as many places as possible, so consumers see the product wherever they go**:

So, we have already established distributors from whom we can distribute our products to the customers. More distributors mean a more penetrating market, more penetrating market means more products will sell that's what we all wanted.

An intensive distribution strategy increases product awareness. The process results in brand loyalty and trust **because the products are made available in multiple shops and establishments**.

# 7\. MARKETING

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676298852377/6f491e9e-a376-4d36-b2e4-5833c2194560.png align="center")

We are planning to do marketing in two phases:

**Phase-01: B2B**

This will **help us reach even more people and encourage them to take advantage of the program so that you can grow your business faster**. By implementing this B2B marketing strategy, they'll be able to drastically increase the number of leads and sales, boost your revenue and customer base, and achieve long-term success.

It is suitable for us because the resources and budget available to us right now are limited. This is one more reason to use B2B.

As years will pass, sales will also increase resulting in an increase in profit. Later on, we can shift to B2C marketing.

**Phase-02: B2C**

* Globalization. Larger-scale B2C businesses often have large target audiences. ...
    
* Low cost. E-commerce B2C models cut down on operational and physical infrastructure costs.
    
* Personalization. ...
    
* Customer experience management. ...
    
* Customer data. ...
    
* Booming business.
    

### How we are unique other than other businesses...?\*

\-**<mark>Own packaging:</mark>**

This makes us more unique because we are using the waste part of bamboo during manufacturing i.e Outer part of bamboo. From which we can make bags ( Multipurpose, sustainable & bio-degradable). And our clothing products are distributed by placing into this bag. This bag also consists of our own **BRANd LOGO** alongside **BRAND NAME**.

# 8\. MARKET CAPITALIZATION

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676298927965/45134bbb-9009-45cc-b612-4407bca8b286.png align="center")

Total Clothing market Capitalization(Worldwide) = 2.5 Trillion

Clothing market Capitalization(Nepal) = 26.4 Arab(1.9 Billion)

**<mark>Revenue Model:</mark>**

If we consider a T-Shirt of our company with

`Selling Prize=1000/-`

`Manufacturing Cost=400/-`

`Retailer margin = 200/-`

`Distribution cost= 200/-`

`Net profit= 200/- i.e. Profit=20%`

**<mark>Expected Market Capture:</mark>**

If we were able to capture only 2.75% of market capitalization, the conclusion goes like this:

`Annual Sales= 73 Cr.`

`Annual Profit= 12 Cr.`

# 9\. FINANCIAL PROJECTION

Financial Projection shows how we invest the upcoming 5 years into market capture, Sales, Manufacturing Cost, Retailer Margin, Distribution Cost, Profit Before Tax, and Net Profit( Profit After Tax).
