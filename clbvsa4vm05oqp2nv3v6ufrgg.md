# Sh*t Your Ego Says

Top 5 Lesson learned from book -**Sh#t Your Ego Says**:


### 1)Sometimes what we need is different from what we want. 
The Ego has desires but those desires are not always in our best interest. When we listen closely, failure can open us to the intuition of the Higher Self.

### 2)We can’t do everything alone.
Failure is a reminder that life is a collaborative effort. Success is not the result of selfish action, but rather the mutual outcome of people working together toward a shared goal.

### 3)There might be a better way.
Failure does not always mean no. Sometimes it just means not this way. When the door it locked, don’t force it open. Simply look for another door.

### 4)Failure is a better teacher than success. 
We don’t learn much from success. But failure is helpful because it puts us in a state of reflection, and reflection is a form of meditation. When we meditate on failure we emerge smarter and stronger.

### 5)Character is forged in fire.
Success is not the result of what we do; it is the result of who we are. Life never gets easier. But we can become strong enough to make it seem easy.
