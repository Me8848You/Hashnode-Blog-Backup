# A Message To Her.

"I am not actually tired, but numb and heavy, and can’t find the right words.
 All I can say is: Stay with me, don’t leave me."

## **Now How The Scenario Changes**

“It’s easy to say move on, but hard to do”..

Ya, that’s true 

But not moving on isn’t really making you happy…is it?
Reliving those memories.. isn’t that devastating?
Walking down the same path everyday where you used to walk with her hand in hand..doesn’t that snatch away the peace of mind?

Darling, it’s a never ending loop, it doesn’t have any boundaries...  
Life teaches us a lot of lessons, and heartbreak is the most common one...
You can’t move on if you don’t allow people to involve and help you...

Happiness is a very precious thing, so when you know you can create the urge to be happy if you try, then why stopping yourself?   

The past won’t help you survive, the lost won’t help you grow…
Stop fighting! Those memories wants to break free...so let them go..
Rewriting those pains will always dominate your happiness...

Don’t do that...

Keep those memories in your heart and move forward...
Life doesn’t stop for anyone...
You see the person who told you yesterday that they will die without you...
Today they are living quite well after leaving you...

You can too...

It’s okay to love again, it’s okay to feel for someone again...
Live everyday like it’s your last day...
Give your life chances before you run out of it...
Lots Of Love, Take Care...
