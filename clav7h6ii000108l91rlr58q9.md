The Unspoken Word by SHE To ME. The Last day of college :(

Everything's gonna be a memory very soon.
This everyday routine. The craziness to see you for at least once in a day.
Your smile, that makes my day. I'm waiting for the end (ready to purpose).   
I don't know is it a good ending or bad. 

I still remember the very first day of college, when I saw you for the first time, right there I was ready to fall in love without any boundary conditions.I was ready to spend my whole life with you not even thinking for a while. 

But I'm still thinking that how I'll manage to make my mind without this every day routine. The routine for you.

Waiting for your entry time in class, waiting for the smell of your favorite perfume, color of your shirt. You know what, sometimes we match our dress color coincidentally and that's made me super happy.

I'll miss this small happiness.           
I'll miss you, your cute smile, your voice, especially your supporting nature and yes, your eyes that say a lot.  Because I know everything gone be memory very soon.         
                       
Then maybe I'll not remember me.   
But trust me, you'll be my sweet memory.   
I'll remember that night and after that the morning, it was very special for me. *

If some day I'll tell you about these days, you'll come to know how special is your memory. 
Till that these sweet memories are only for me... 

-SHE always & forever.
