The author's method is the DISA model.
  • Dominance

Each explains a primary type of behavior.

3. When you communicate the listener filters it into a message they can understand.
Rarely, is this message what you meant to communicate.

4. Adapt your communication based on the behavior type of the listener.
Communicate on their terms, with language familiar to them.

5. The only times it's effective to communicate without adapting is when you're alone or in a room with people just like you.
Otherwise, consider the other person's behavior.

6. The best teams have a blend of every behavioral type. Which allows them to make the most of everyone's strengths while minimizing their weaknesses.

7. Certain combinations of behavioral types collaborate more effectively.
For example, introverts prefer to work with one another.

8. If you're not sure what behavioral type you're working with, listen for a while.
Pay attention to what they like to talk about to figure out their styles.

9. Each behavioral type gets stressed and responds to stress differently.
For example, dominant types get stressed when you take their authority away.
