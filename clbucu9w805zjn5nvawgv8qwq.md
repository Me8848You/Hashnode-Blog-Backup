# Outliers

Top 10 Lessons learned From the Book- "**Outliers**"

1. We do a mistake if we cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit.

### 2. Achievement = Talent + Practice / Preparation.
What is difficult to acquire is the consistency needed to be successful.
That comes purely from your love of your craft.

### 3. Approx 10,000 Hours of practice is required to be a world class expert in anything.
It can take roughly 10 years to put in 10,000 hours of practice.
So, think before you take a jump, instead of getting excited with initial success.

### 4. 10,000 hours is an enormous amount of time.
You can't do it all alone. You will need a lot of encouragement and support.

### 5. IQ matters, but only up to a point.
Beyond that, its your attitude.
Just like basketball, height matters, but that's just up to a point.

### 6. No one make it alone. No one.
Everyone needs guidance and support at the right age.
Good parenting and a great environment are critical in producing legends.

7. When you accept a salary, it basically boils down to what you feel is right vs what you can do to receive the next paycheck.

8. The opportunities you are presented with for success are not only dependent on your inner qualities, your parenting, but also the time you were born in this world.

### 9. Snowball
Most air accidents are not a result of any major mechanical or technical failures.
These are usually small incidents that happen one after another - which either get unnoticed or are not communicated properly in an unambiguous manner.

10. No one... Who rises before dawn 365 days a year... Will fail to make his family rich.
