# Think And Grow Rich

10 Lessons Of Book "Think & Grow Rich" -Napoleon Hill

“Think & Grow Rich” is one of the top universally recognized personal development masterpieces of Napoleon Hill.

To put it in simple terms, you can become anything that your mind believes is possible;
as a result, your mind becomes the one thing that can stop you or push you toward becoming the best of yourself.

There are only 10 lessons from "Think & Grow Rich" for any person to acquire a destiny and find real success.

1. Desire
Napoleon Hill describes in his book "Think & Grow Rich", everything starts with a desire. How badly you want something in your life.
You would not have the desire that you have unless you were capable of achieving it.
But it is your burning desire that is simply an accurate picture of what you will become.
But your desire has to be a burning desire. And when you decide to achieve your desire. 
Therefore, in a way, desire is the one stage that links thoughts and actions together:
Thoughts → Commitment (or Desire) → Action
“Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.” 
And this is regardless of how many times you have failed in the past.

2. Faith
Faith is the solid expectation of things hoped for, the visible demonstration of the power of your thoughts and feelings. 
You can create the impossible through faith.
But negative thoughts of anger, hatred, or jealousy will kill any benefit of having faith. 
Therefore you have to have a positive attitude about whatever it is you want to achieve.
When you believe in yourself and in your dreams, you can achieve anything.

3. Auto Suggestion
This is the ability to focus your mind on your burning desire so much that your subconscious mind accepts it as fact.
Autosuggestion is a suggestion/affirmation by yourself, to yourself.
Write down your goal and desire and repeat it with positive attitude that becomes a reality of life.

4. Specialized Knowledge
Now we know Thoughts = Desire = Action
Never stop acquiring specialized skill related to your major purpose, business, or profession. 
Those who are not successful usually believe that once you finish school then acquiring knowledge has ended. 
The truth is that all schooling does is to help you in the way of learning how to acquire practical knowledge.
You need to keep on learning and improving your knowledge and action plan to achieve your desire.

5. Imagination
“Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.” 
And this is regardless of how many times you have failed in the past.
You have to develop the power of self-motivation and the best way to do that is through imagination.
Imagination gives clarity and self-motivation of the action towards your plan.

6. Organized Planning
I always talk about how much-organized planning is required when it comes to being efficient.
The book "Think & Grow Rich" also mentioned that to achieve your goal you have to be organized and plan your activities in a way that leads you to success.

7. Decision
Procrastination is the opposite of a decision and is the enemy of everyone desiring success.
All successful people make decisions very fast, but they change them very slowly. 
And all unsuccessful people make decisions very slowly and change them fast and often.
Draw your life plan and put across things you need to focus on to achieve things in your life. 
It may be a habit, learning, or decision-making skills.
The faster you can decide to not put up with people whose aim is just that of bringing you and your dreams down the better.

8. Persistence
Persistence is the one quality that you must have in order to become successful. 
It is the main part of a person’s character that separates those who do not achieve from the achievers.
So many of us give up right before success. 
But when you learn persistence and the concepts of decision, you can push forward to the award of victory.

9. Power of the Mastermind
A mastermind group is a group of two people who support one another in attaining their goals, plans, and dreams.
It is a group of people who are sympathetic to your desire. 
They can help you to excite your mind for new thoughts and keep pushing.

10. The Subconscious Mind
"Think & Grow Rich" mentions that the subconscious part of your brain is like an archive/storage: it receives and contains your thoughts and impressions, regardless of their nature. It can solve our problems if we go about it the right way.
Your brain is the most marvelous, miraculous, and powerful force the world has ever known.
The mind is designed to help you to bring to you everything that you want. Use it for what it was intended for.

Cheers to your success.
