# Someone:)

Having someone who you can talk to from a morning text to a good night is a blessing...
Someone who you can open up to without being shy...

Someone who you can be yourself and show all your personalities ...
The clingy, the weird, and the crazy you ...

Someone who accepts you and never judge you...
Someone who knows how to listen to you without being bored ...

Someone who you enjoy talking to in different topics...
And even if thereâ€™s no topic...
You two still want to talk...

Having someone like that is a real blessing...


### She Actually Came Right Here After 3 Years....


I am an introvert not handsome guy but 3 years ago an extrovert beautiful girl was hitting on me, i thought she was just playing with my feelings for some reason but we've been together now for 6 years planning to get married.

One day i asked her why did she  like me back then? And she said "because you're a mysterious guy, you don't talk to girls and when i tried to talk to you, you just ignored me". 

I'm still uncomfortable going to her house meeting with her family but she's always there to cheer me up.

Don't lose hope my man, someone is there waiting for you.ðŸ’¯

She is also waiting for you :
