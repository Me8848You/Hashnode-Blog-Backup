Top 3 Lesson Learned from book- Do Epic Shit 

### Lesson 1: Time won’t come back

Everyone has a dream but everyone won’t go after their dreams because some of them are afraid and some of them don’t believe in them.

So if you have goals and if you believe in them then don’t think much and start today or better start now.
Don’t say, I will start tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and you will be like, not today, maybe, next week and one day, you will forget about it.

Time is now, time will be tomorrow but you won’t be there forever, one day time will pass and you will end up with regrets, so don’t be that guy who complains a lot about everything.
Respect time and do things at the right time.

### Lesson 2: Don’t run after goals, run after habits

Yes, I do set goals and I want to complete the goals in a particular time frame.
Let’s say, you want to wake up at 6:00 AM every day, so to do that, you have to go to sleep at 10:00 PM. This way, you won’t feel tired all day but if you go to sleep at 2:00 AM then you won’t be waking up at 6:00 and even if you do, your day will get ruined.

Next time, you won’t bother to wake up at 6:00 AM.
So work on habits, even small habits can make a huge impact, you won’t see the small changes now but when time goes by, you will start seeing the results.

The same can be applied to exercise, you won’t see the results on the first day but after a month or two, you will notice the changes.
So focus on small habits, and in the end, you will be closer to your goals.

### Lesson 3: Money

Don’t go after money, work every day, and money will come after you.
Everyone says, how to save money but no one tells you, what to do with that money. Most people will start FD rather than investing in Stock Market or even in mutual funds because no one has never told them to do so.

Ankur Warikoo has also made lots of mistakes with money which you will learn from the book.
Be careful with your money.

Sometimes, a new smartphone can make us happy and sometimes a cup of coffee, so try to void all of these things. Don’t rely on materialistic things, if you can be happy without products then you will save lots of money and the same can be used for your business idea or even for investment.
