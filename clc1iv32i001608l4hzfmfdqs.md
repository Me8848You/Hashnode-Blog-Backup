# Introduction-Who am I ...?\*

Hii Hashnoders, I am Suman Sharma, a developer from NEPALðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ. I'm a 5th-sem college student studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology.

In this blog post, I'm going to share my journey of how I got into programming and how I've kept my passion for it alive.

**It does not seem to be interesting, is it?\***

It's not interesting at all. You might find it so boring and at the end of this blog, you might say it is a typical loser's way of protecting themselves ahead of success. Yeah, you might be true but I just want to tell you here I am representing those who are not good as you.

## Journey As a Developer

It might sound funny but I indeed had my first touch with the computer at the age of 20. I used to see those people who sit in front of a computer and do their tasks look Quite Impressive to me.

In 2019, I was admitted to the college for higher studies in Information Technology but at that, I don't even know about the subject I have been studying. 1st and 2nd sem I do nothing rather I enjoy college life :).

When I enter the 3rd sem, I become a little bit more serious about my carrier and started to learn. I learned C and C++ in 3rd sem with the intent of doing something in the field of computer engineering.

4th sem become so much more fruitful as I learned HTML, CSS & Javascript then I make some static web pages, at that time I try to build my portfolio website. Till now I can make dynamic pages and love to work as a web developer.

## Experience From -2022

I have lots of topics to explore. In 2022, I learned Node.js as a javascript backend runtime environment and still exploring it.

## Challenges I Faced:

As a developer/programmer, If I try to learn something over the internet faced lots of problems like :

1. **College**\- they don't teach you what's required by the industry.
    
2. **Youtube**\- The courses on youtube are good but there is no proper roadmap to study and our doubts are never solved.
    
3. Good courses take a lot of money which many of us **can't afford**.
    
4. Many times, you **can't find the best carrier path** for eg. (what to do next? / Is it right what I am doing? / Should I stick with these technologies or shift to a new one if so which one?\*)
    

## Lessons I learned:)

Till now, I have faced lots of problems but I had never given up. I explore the internet and technologies day by day.

Every day I make a schedule to stay in front of the computer for at least 2 hours a day. At the end of the session, I asked myself "Did I learned something new?". If I get the answer "**YES**" then can sleep peacefully.

Whatever the cost spend time i.e **Investing in yourself**, You will learn something at least a single new thing.

## Accomplishment I achieved.

I accept that right now I am in the learning phase so I have zero expectations but rather explore myself for "I am born for".

Little achievement gives me lots of motivation, You can also find such. Motivate yourself. Explore over the internet. Bringing the best version of yourself is what I want and you also. Focus on you right now, It will pay for you just work and see........

## **That's my journey**

**thank you for reading, and Keep Learning.**
