# You Are a Badass

Top 6 lessons from book-" You Are a Badass " by Jen Sincero

### 1) Why You Must Live in the Present Moment.
You must practice living in the present moment because, according to Jen Sincero, living in the present unites you with Vortex/God and raises your frequency. A higher frequency enables you to attract higher-frequency experiences such as abundance, joy, laughter, and bliss.

### 2) You Have a Shadow Self and a True Self.
Your shadow self, the Ego, is guided by your limiting beliefs, and it either lives in the past or future. It is unaware that you are connected to your surroundings, and it loves praise and validation.
Conversely, your true self is in alignment with God/Spirit, and it often strives to attract a reality that matches your true potential.

### 3) Trust Your Intuition.
Always trust your intuition because your intuition is your inner guidance that has all the answers you need. Stop taking people’s advice and rely on your intuition when making decisions or taking action.

### 4) Why You Must Meditate.
Meditation enables you to fall in alignment with Source Energy/Universal Energy. This alignment strengthens your intuition, relaxes you, puts you in a good mood, raises your frequency, and brings you in the present moment.

### 5) The Importance of Gratitude.
According to Jen Sincero, you must practice gratitude because it moves you nearer to Source Energy/God and makes it easy for you to manifest the things you want. You must also practice gratitude because when in gratitude, you release positive energy which comes back to you.

### 6) How to Practice Gratitude.
The best way to be thankful is to practice seeing the positive side of everything that happens. Always find reasons to make every occurrence a good one. If you lose your job don’t focus on how life might be hard without a salary. Instead, realize that being jobless will allow you to go after what you truly want in life.
