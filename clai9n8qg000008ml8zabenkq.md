# She & Us

The connection 

I always felt I had a calming connection with you,
I always had this strong feeling of attachment towards you, 
I still believe that those eyes never lied, those words were not just for us to be happy, those touch didn’t just fade away..

I know it my conscious that you will never come back, but my heart can feel the smell of your hair that brushed my cheeks,  it can feel those seconds spend in your arms, those touch and that voice still whispers love..

I never changed our playlist..those lyrics feels like your unspoken words..
That lane still reminds the day we walked back home..

The pain is not gone, not even faded..my heart screams for you but I still manage to go on..
There’s one thing though, 

You asked me to hold on to us, I held on, your absence makes me hollow from within, but I will always hold on to us..

Though you are gone, the attachment grew strong..
