# A Motivation To Myself.

As hard as life may feel right now we must remember my loves, you are not broken. Pieces of you are suffering tremendous pain, and life is extremely difficult.

### *

Trust that you can do this hard thing. Nothing in life is permanent.
Maya Angelou says, “Every storm runs out of rain.”

### *

Have unshakeable faith and courage in yourself. This is not the end of your story. No matter how you’re feeling today, trust that it will change.

### *

You will be staring back in the mirror at a stronger, wiser, confident, and more resilient you. Believe in yourself. 🖤
