# The Magic Of Thinking Big

Top 10 Lesson learned from rom  book -**The Magic of Thinking Big**

### 1. Believe You Can Succeed And You Will
When you have an “I-can-do-it” attitude, the how-to-do-it traits develop in your mind. Believing that you WILL succeed is one of the basic and essential traits of successful people.
Schwartz says that it is great to admire and respect leaders; study and observe them. However do not worship them. Aim to be better than them.

How you see yourself, is how others see you.
Think success, not failure. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief.

### 2. Stop Making Excuses
The common excuses people make are;
- Age: I’m too young/old
- Health: I’m not well
- Intelligence: I’m not smart enough
- Luck: I’m not lucky enough

When it comes to your health be genuinely grateful for your health, it is better to wear out then rust out.
We sometimes underestimate our own brain power, and overestimate others. Don’t. The ability to think is much greater than the ability to memorize facts.
Eliminate the habit of making excuses; see reasons why you can succeed. The right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.

### 3. Build Confidence & Destroy Fear
Action cures fear. Indecision, delays on the other hand, feed fear. You should deposit only positive thoughts into your memory.

### 4. Think & Dream Creatively
Big people monopolize listening. Small people monopolize talking. Top leaders spend more time requesting advice than they do giving it.

### 5. You Are What You Think You Are
As a leader the way you think towards your job determines how those around you think towards their jobs. Look important.
Think your work is important. Use the technique of “selling-yourself-to yourself”.

### 6. Manage Your Environments
The company you surround yourself with will surely have an impact on your success. It is up to you to surround yourself with people who uplift you and whose presence calls forth your best. Analyze your crew, filter out negativity, and dedicate time to relationships. Remember -people who tell you that it cannot be done are usually unsuccessful people.

### 7. Make Your Attitudes Your Allies
Attitudes are mirrors of the mind, they reflect thinking. When our attitude is right, our abilities reach a maximum of effectiveness and good results inevitably follow.
Grow three attitudes:

i. The attitude of “**I’m activated**”
Results come in proportion to the enthusiasm invested. Dig in deeper when you find yourself disinterested in something, learn more about it. This sets off the enthusiasm.
Always try to have energy; your smile, your handshake, talk and walk. Act alive. Always broadcast good news. No one will ever accomplish anything positive by telling bad news.

ii. The attitude of “**You are important**”
People do more for you when you make them feel important. When you help others feel important, you help yourself feel important too.
Practice appreciation.
Practice calling people by their names.
Don’t hog the glory, invest it instead.

iii. The attitude of “**Service first**”
Put service first and money takes care of itself. Give people more than they expect to get.

### 8. Think Right Towards People
Success depends on the support of other people. The only hurdle between you and what you want to be is support from others. A person is not pulled up to a higher level job, they are rather lifted up.
It is a mark of real leadership to take the lead in getting to know people. The person who does the most talking and the person who is the most successful are rarely the same person.

### 9. Turn Defeat Into Victory
Study your setbacks to pave your way to success. Have the courage to be your own constructive critic, stop blaming luck. Blend persistence with experimentation and remember – there is a good side in every situation.

### 10. Think Like A Leader
Achieving high-level success requires the support and the cooperation of others. Schwartz gave various principles on leadership.

Trade minds with the people you want to influence, try to understand them.

“Be-Human” in dealing with others , show that you put others before yourself. Think about progress, believe in progress, and push for progress. Take time out to confer with yourself.
