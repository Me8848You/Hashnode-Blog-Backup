# 19 Money Rules Everyone Should Learn By 25

### 1. Pay yourself first.
As soon as you get paid, put money into saving. Automating this is even better.

### 2. Keep a 6-month emergency fund.
If you have multiple streams of income, you can go as low as 3 months.

If starting out on your own, you could need as much as 12 months.

### 3. Budget using the 50/30/20 rule.

- 50% for  needs.
- 30% for wants.
- 20% towards saving/investing 

This is the bare minimum!

### 4. Divide your bonus into thirds.
- 1/3 for fun
- 1/3 for retirement
- 1/3 for debt paydown (add to retirement if only low-interest debt)

### 5. Put all, or a large %, of your raise into saving and investing
This helps avoid lifestyle inflation and moves up your retirement date.

### 6. Avoid high-interest debt.
If you have it, use the avalanche or the snowball method to pay it off (google them)

### 7. Always take an employer 401k match.
Many employers will match a percentage of your paycheck.

 This money is getting an immediate 100% return.

If you turn this down, it's the same as turning down a raise.

### 8. Your home payment.
Mortgage, interest, insurance should cost less than 25% of your monthly income.

### 9. When buying a car use the 20/4/10 Rule if you  have to.
- 20% down
- 4-year loan
- <10% of your monthly income
I still prefer to buy an older vehicle with cash, but each to their own.

### 10. You should save at least 15% 
Of your income for retirement.

### 11. Your age subtracted from 100
Represents the percentage of stocks you should have in your portfolio.

Some are now using the number 120.

### 12. The stock market.
Has a long-term  average return of 10%.

To calculate your returns, it's common to use 6-8% to capture the effect of inflation.

### 13. The rule of 72.
 Tell you how long it will take your investment to double.

Example: The stock market returns 10%, so 72/10 i.e 7.2 years to double your money.

### 14. The 4-percent rule
It says you can safely withdraw 4% of your starting investment balance each year (adjust for inflation in subsequent year) and not run out of money.

### 15. Your Net Worth.
Should be equal to your age x Pre-Tax income/10.

For example: If you are 35 years old and $100000 is your annual income, then your net worth should be $350000 (35x100000/10).

### 16. Have at least five times.
Your gross salary in term life insurance.

### 17. Before spending money.
Wait 24 hours and ask: Do i still want it? If you do, go ahead and buy it. This will save you from a lot of impulse purchases.

### 18. Save for retirement first,
Then your children's education.

### 19. Value time over money
And experience over things.
