# The Subtle Art Of Not Giving F*ck.

Top 10 Lessons  learned From the Book “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck”

1) Life isn’t meant to go your way all the time, and that’s OK.
🟢When we give too many f*cks, when we choose to give a f*ck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, that’s when life f*cks us.

2) Pick your battles wisely. Invest your energy where it matters.
👉Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a f*ck about what’s truly f*ck-worthy.

3) Doing too much is the same as doing nothing at all.
🔴We are defined by what we choose to reject. And if we reject nothing we essentially have no identity at all.

4) Failure is a part of life.
✅Failure is how you learn and grow.
If you think about a young child trying to learn to walk, that child will fall down and hurt itself hundreds of times. But at no point does that child ever stop and think, ‘Oh, I guess walking just isn’t for me.

5) Your fear of failure is your biggest enemy.
We can be truly successful only at something we’re willing to fail at.
❌If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed.

6) You can’t ever really “find yourself”
Because who you are will constantly change, and that’s a good thing.
👉That’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

7) Not every “problem” has to be a negative thing.
Don’t hope for a life without problems. There’s no such thing.
✅Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”

8) 😎 Once you’re great at one thing, aim to be great at another.
🟢People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great – they are mediocre, they are average – and that they could be so much better.

9) It’s important to stop and be content with what you have once in a while.
The more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become,
👉as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.

10) Hard times are a necessary part of life.
✅Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.

- perspective

- Timing
- decision making process
